Another simple Vanilla JS project.
This time I played around a bit and now I have a simple "counter" app. 
You have 3 buttons: decrease, reset and increase.
The "starting number" is zero.
If you get a number which is "positive" (>0) then the color of the number changes to green, on the other hand when the number is <0 the color changes to red.

Feel free to try it out :)
